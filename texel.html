      <p>Texel is one of the Dutch Wadden Islands, off the coast of the Netherlands. Itâ€™s known for the bird-rich Dunes of Texel National Park, with its sandy beaches, grass-topped dunes and forest trails. In the park, Ecomare is a nature museum, aquarium and wildlife sanctuary for seals and birds. On the island's northern tip, the 19th-century Texel Lighthouse offers panoramic views of the North Sea and Wadden Sea.
