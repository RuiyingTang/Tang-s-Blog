    <h1>Texel</h1>
    <img src="texel.jpg">
    <p>Texel is one of the Dutch Wadden Islands, off the coast of the Netherlands. Itâ€™s known for the bird-rich Dunes of
      Texel National Park, with its sandy beaches, grass-topped dunes and forest trails. In the park, Ecomare is a nature
      museum, aquarium and wildlife sanctuary for seals and birds. On the island's northern tip, the 19th-century Texel
      Lighthouse offers panoramic views of the North Sea and Wadden Sea.
